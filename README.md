This repository contains a banking interface project developed as part of a technical interview for Silicon Village. The application was built using Spring for the backend and React for the frontend, simulating core banking operations within a modern full-stack architecture.

The project focused on clean architecture, RESTful API design, state management, and integration between client and server. It demonstrates best practices in code organization, validation, and user experience.

The solution was successfully presented during the technical interview process and met the proposed requirements, showcasing my ability to design and deliver a complete full-stack application under evaluation conditions.
